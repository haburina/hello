      <h5>What is Crash Course?</h5>
      <p>We create free, high-quality educational videos used by teachers and learners of all kinds. That's all we want to do. After 200,000,000 views, it turns out people like this. And our videos aren't just for schools; the majority of our viewers, around 60% - 70%, watch Crash Course without being currently enrolled in an associated class.</p>
      <p style="padding: 10px 0 0 0;">So far, we've taught Chemistry, World History, Biology, Ecology, US History, Psychology, Big History, Literature, Intellectual Property, and we're in the middle of Anatomy and Physiology, Astronomy, US Government, Kids: Science, and Economics.</p>
      <h5>Here's an Example:</h5>
